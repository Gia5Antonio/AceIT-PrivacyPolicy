If you allow AceIT to access data from the Health app, with your permission, AceIT will read your entries for Steps, Walking + Running Distance and Heart Rate if such data exist. AceIT will aggregate and correlate those data back to your tennis activities so that you can understand your stats (e.g. your footwork on the court) when you are playing a tennis match.

Your health data will not be passed on to any servers, third parties or used for any marketing or promotional purposes. The data is only used by AceIT to provide the functionality outlined above.

# Description 

AceIT is a tennis app designed for Apple Watch. It turns your Apple Watch into a simple and easy-to-use device in order to track your tennis matches. 
All matches are stored on your iPhone and you can see a more detailed analysis of them with also more information than the Apple Watch app.

In the Apple Watch app you can see these informations:
-Percentage of forehand and backhand;
-Timer of the match;
-Live heart rate monitor;
-Last shot speed greater than 40 Km/h.
You can also see a little summary of the match data when you finish it after tapping the End button.

Moreover in the iPhone app you can see these informations:
-Date of the match;
-Timer of the match;
-Heart rate average during the match;
-Percentage and exact number of forehand and backhand;
-Average shot speed of all the match;
-Steps count and total distance.
You can see these data for all the matches you play using the app.

How to use the app:
You just need your Apple Watch, without external sensors!
It is simple. Just start the app from your Apple Watch and follow the instructions. 

We would love to hear about your thoughts on how we can improve the app. You can contact us through our email or our facebook page.

Future feature:
In the next future we would add some other feature as the serve and vol√®e recognition and the tracking system of the tennis player in the field in order to analyse better your matches.
